        The Research Of Animal Movement group discusses techniques and analysis for data that tracks animals in time and space, 
      and revel in the delights of movement ecology. We seek to increase capacity building in our community to support effective 
      delivery of research and increase research outcomes using the most adequate tools for the job.
